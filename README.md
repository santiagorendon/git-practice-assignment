[How to Get Hired as a Software Engineer by Google](https://www.webpronews.com/software-engineer-google/)

This article was interresting it involved advice on landing a google internship in software engineering given by young engineers hired by Google. That makes this article a quite reliable source and indicates that following their advice would increase the chances of nailing the job. The article states that Google interviews involve a few warm up questions and then one long difficult question. The interview is supposed to focus on mixing and matching Data Structures to solve the question. Vivian Li a current engineer said the interviewers are usually helpful and will help guide your solutions to the ones they are looking for. Another engineer Oliver King said it is useful to speak outloud to allow the interviewer to understand your thought process. Finally the last key point I took away from the article that giving a solution is most important so do not focus too much on the fastest cost efficent solution, make sure you have a basic solution first.

This is actually a very good article. I used it in my interviews as well.



**Muhammad Hassan (mh4722):** Although all of the advices mentioned by young engineeres are note-worhty, the most important I can relate to is by Vivian Li. It is imperative that before starting to code actually, we take a step back and relaize the big problem we are trying to solve. Getting into coding right away will lead us towards hard work, not smart work. Happy coding.
